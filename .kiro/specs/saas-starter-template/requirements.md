# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the existing Convex auth magic links project into a comprehensive SaaS starter template that developers can use as a foundation for their projects. The template should include essential pages, features, and documentation needed to quickly launch a SaaS application, while maintaining the existing authentication system and adding new functionality for landing pages, pricing, blog, dashboard, and SEO optimization. The entire aesthetic should follow Susan Kare's iconic design principles from Apple's early design team - featuring pixel-perfect iconography, bitmap typography, clean geometric patterns, and the distinctive visual language that defined the original Macintosh interface. All copy and messaging should be written in the sophisticated, persuasive style of Mad Men's Donald Draper - confident, compelling, and crafted to sell the dream.
